hello-world
===========

My first GitHub project.

Hi, I'm Luke of the University of Freiburg, and I'm planning to use GitHub for efficient version control of the many documents I will be authoring in XeLaTeX, with R input through Knitr, as well as concise, functional, well-written Python, Haskell and C++ projects which will enhance my employability in a post-doc two years down the line (it's currently August 2014), or, more to the point, my chances of success in post-doc interviews one year down the line!
